description: Highlighting VCs committed to diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplaces
---


### _“As an entrepreneur, if I experience harassment or discrimination, where do I report it and how will I be protected?”_

This question emerged at a founders dinner a few months ago. None of us had a good answer, so, true to form, we started brainstorming. We asked our friends in VC if their firms had external policies and/or a reporting channel.

In opening the conversation, we learned that the issue was already top of mind for many VCs. But it was hard to see what individual firms were doing from the outside. So #MovingForward was born.


### **#MovingForward gathers VC commitments to foster a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplace.**

Specifically, our supporters have provided:
* Their anti-harassment/discrimination policies
* Point(s)-of-contact for entrepreneurs to ask questions and report issues
* A short statement on their efforts to nurture diverse, inclusive and harassment-free workplaces

**This directory is open-source.** Any firm can add and update their policies and point(s)-of-contact, and we hope that every major venture firm will participate.

## Why #MovingForward
+ **Value for Firms:** VCs say the process of making their policies public and establishing reporting lines has sparked conversations and aligned the firm’s partnership internally around this matter. We hope this movement further motivates that process.
+ **Value for Founders:** #MovingForward strives to make it easier for founders to review policies, find supportive investors, and identify a reporting contact. If you don’t see your investors here, share this project with them.

### But really, why are you doing this?

 A small group of entrepreneurs came together with three goals:

 1. **Launch a public, collective step forward for the venture industry.** We aim to highlight each firm's approach and commitment so that we can learn and move together. Crafting external anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies is just a first step––there’s much more do to, and a number of organizations are launching initiatives to catalyze real change.

 2. **Facilitate transparent reporting channels and information routes.** Entrepreneurs facing harassment or discrimination are often unsure where to go to report. It can feel like going public is the only choice, and as such, our community faces a large issue of under-reporting.
 One way firms can address this need is by providing formal point(s)-of-contact for entrepreneurs. Some VCs are working with third-party HR consulting groups to nail down the proper templates/policies or reporting channels for raising concerns.
 We also support having internal point(s)-of-contact contact who can answer questions about the firm’s policy and provide further information if need be.

 3. **Provide a universal, open-source, and evolving wiki for continuous updates.** As policies and supporting strategies evolve and the industry continues to iterate, we want to provide an open forum for any firm to [self-report](https://airtable.com/shrudsWooa1wa7sCm) their efforts. We’ve hosting [this directory on GitHub](https://github.com/WeAreMovingForward/wearemovingforward.github.io).
